My Questions Re-Worded:
Question 7: Are there differences in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) scores between males and females?
	According to the data we see that females have a higher average anxiety (GAD7 Score) and higher depression average more than males.



Question 8. What is the relationship between daily screen time and sleep duration?
	Daily screen time shows a negative relationship with sleep duration, where users with higher screen time tend to get less sleep. In other words, the more hours the user spends daily, the less sleep they get.



Question 5: Do users with late-night social media usage have higher anxiety (GAD-7) or depression (PHQ-9) scores?
Both males and females with late night usage tend to have more depression and anxiety than males and females who do not have late night usage. 



Question 6: Is passive social media use associated with worse mental health outcomes than active posting?
Yes. Both males and females with an active activity on social media tend to have less depression and anxiety than males and females who have a passive activity on social media. In other words, users who engage in active social media activity show higher average depression and anxiety scores than users who engage in passive activity.



Question 9: Are users with social comparison triggers more likely to fall into moderate-to-severe anxiety or depression categories?
Overall, there are minimal triggers to no triggers.



Question 12: Which activity types are most associated with social comparison triggers?
Users who engage in active social media activity are more likely to experience social comparison triggers than users who engage in passive activity.



Question 3: How do primary platforms differ in average sleep duration and anxiety scores, by gender?
Male users of the Facebook platform tend to have the highest average sleep duration, slightly more than women. And gets less sleep on the Instagram platform.
Female users of the Instagram tend to have the highest sleep duration, slightly more than women. And gets less sleep on the Snapchat platform.

Male users of the Instagram platform show the highest average anxiety scores, with more anxiety than women.
Female users of the Tiktok platform show the highest average anxiety scores, with more anxiety than men.



Question 4: How does dominant content type relate to daily screen time?
Users who primarily consume "self-help and motivation" content spend the most average time on social media per day, while "Lifestyle and Fashion" content is associated with lower daily screen time.”



Question 11: Does dominant content type affect depression levels (PHQ-9)?
The type of content a user watches indeed affects their depression levels. The type of content for highest scores of depression were "Self Help/Motivtion", while the least scores of depression was the content "Lifestyle & Fashion". In other words, Users who primarily consume "self Help/Motivation" content exhibit higher average depression scores compared to users who consume "Lifestyle & Fashion" content.”



Question 12: Does lower daily social media screen time associate with better mental health, by gender?
Depression and anxiety start to increase the more their daily screen time. 
However: 

⦁	The more time the women spend on social media, the higher their depression and anxiety scores way much more higher than the men. The men's anxiety and depression do rise up the more time they spend, but not as drastic or nearly enough as the women.
⦁	For the women, the threshold for when their depression and anxiety starts to get worse is when their daily screen time hits 4 hours. In other words, the depression and anxiety level of the women starts to increase when the women spends over 4 hours on social media.
⦁	As for the men, the threshold for when their depression starts to get worse is when their daily screen time is also 4 hours in to. 




So what can we conclude from this data?

I say this without ANY bias:

* Women due to how different they can be from men (not in a bad way of course) can suffer a bit more than mad in the way they handle social media:
    For example:
      * Their depression and anxiety can boost up when they spend more than 4 hours, a little bit higher, than opposed to when a man does.
      * TikTok and Snapchat are the apps that cause them to sleep less, which is okay, but not ideal for their condition if they want to have less depression.
      * TikTok causes their anxiety to rise.
      * The type of content they consume also matters.
* Men are different (not in a bad way or good way) tend to have more depression and anxiety on Instagram as well, not just women. It also depends on the app, because the way Instagram works may not be the same as TikTok.
